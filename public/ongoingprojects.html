                    <h4 style="color: black;font-weight: bold;margin-top: 2%;">Samathuvapuam</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In 1998, created a caste neutral community through a housing
                        programme meant for all communities thus inspiring the
                        “Samathuvapuram” idea in government.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The idea had an interested origin. In 1998, the panchayat was
                        working for giving housing site for poor families.
                        There was a land available where only Scheduled caste familieslived.

                        But the homeless poor from other communities also started demanding housing sites for them. The
                        panchayat explained to
                        them that the only one piece of land was available that too in the area where SC community lived
                        but surprisingly
                        everyone agreed and the allotment was done with people from different communities lived side-
                        by-side as neighbours to
                        the SC families. This became a historical event and when the then CM M. Karunanidhi was
                        approached for financial
                        support, he appreciated it and directed all the District Collectors to replicate the model. The
                        CM also encouraged
                        Kuthambakkam to go for eco-friendly and cost effective technologies for constructing
                        Samathuvapuram.

                    <!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">According to the constitution, the state governments should form the
                        state election commission and conduct elections for
                        every five year term without leaving any vacancy. The states should devolve enough powers, funds
                        and functionaries in
                        such a way the panchayats could function as local self governments. Except Kerala state, all
                        other states have put least
                        efforts in this process and the emergence of panchayats as local self governments is still a
                        struggle and in reality the
                        system is drifting. Year by year the Panchayat system is weakened and instead of
                        decentralisation of power it is getting
                        centralized towards district administration and stumbling at block level development
                        administration. Still there is hope
                        to recover and rebuild the system because it is a democratic process and also the community
                        system is still alive in
                        villages. There may be problems like deep caste system and other traditional backward practices
                        but through grama sabhas
                        and community groups, it is possible to overcome these difficulties.</p> -->

                        officials and elected members
                        and also approved a huge funding for a hut less village program for Kuthambakkam.</p>

                    </h4>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Elango started a Rural Technology Resource Centre at Kuthambakkam
                        that seeks to use appropriate technologies to train
                        rural youth, women and farmers forlivelihood.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">To stop children from dropping out of school, he helped upgrade the

                        then to a Higher secondary school.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Several micro enterprises were developed to make the village self
                        dependent.</p>

                        and also connected with Chennai-Tirupati state
                        highway. The children who pass 5thstandard were going to High Schools at Tirumazhisai or
                        Poonamallee to continue their
                        high school education. Walking for more than seven to eight kilo metersevery day at the very
                        early age was a real
                        difficulty and this was the reason for almost 100% dropout before completing SSLC. Elango took a
                        tireless effort and
                        brought the high school by upgrading the elementary school to middle school and then the middle
                        school to high school in
                        the year 2011 and it was further up graded to a higher secondary school in the year 2016. Now 60

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Panchayat raj system was passed in the parliament in 1992
                        through 73rd constitutional amendment and the democratic
                        decentralisation process being practiced in almost all the states except few union territories.
                        In Tamilnadu state it
                        was passed in the state assembly in October 1994 and the first Panchayat Elections were
                        conducted in October 1996. Four
                        terms of panchayts are completed and the fifth term is going on. Year by year the powers
                        devolved to the panchayats are
                        shrinking, more centralised government scheme are emerging and panchayats are just functioning
