                    <h4 style="color: black;font-weight: bold;margin-top: 2%;">1. The Status of Panchayats</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The 73rd constitutional amendment guarantees the village level local self governments as village panchayats. The 9th
                    schedule of the constitution empowers the panchayats by earmarking 29 areas under section243G in order to make the
                    panchayats to function as local self governments. The constitution also emphasises that the states should devolve the
                    functions, funds and functionaries to enable the panchayats to deliver the services to achieve social justice and
                    economic development.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Panchayat raj act was passed in the parliament in 1992 and it was also passed in Tamilnadu State Assembly in 1994.
                    The first Panchayat elections were conducted in October 1996 and four terms of five year are completed. Fifth term
                    election which was due in October 2016 was not conducted due to political crisis and the special officer’s period was
                    dragged for more than three years which was unconstitutional. This period of 2016 October to 2019 December was a dark
                    period, because of the non-availability of elected local governments which lead to complete drip in the steady upward
                    development in the villages. The corrupt practices in the official methods, tender systems, centralized purchases,
                    meager transparency and complete breakdown of people participation became the blow in the gradual empowerment of
                    Panchayat Raj System in Tamilnadu state. Atlast with the Supreme Courts intervention, the village panchayat level
                    elections were conducted that too leaving nine newly formed districts.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">According to the constitution, the state governments should form the state election commission and conduct elections for
                    every five year term without leaving any vacancy. The states should devolve enough powers, funds and functionaries in
                    such a way the panchayats could function as local self governments. Except Kerala state, all other states have put least
                    efforts in this process and the emergence of panchayats as local self governments is still a struggle and in reality the
                    system is drifting. Year by year the Panchayat system is weakened and instead of decentralisation of power it is getting
                    centralized towards district administration and stumbling at block level development administration. Still there is hope
                    to recover and rebuild the system because it is a democratic process and also the community system is still alive in
                    villages. There may be problems like deep caste system and other traditional backward practices but through grama sabhas
                    and community groups, it is possible to overcome these difficulties.</p>


                    <h4 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;margin-top: 2%;">2. Kuthambakkam as Model Panchayat
</h4>
                   <p style="text-align: justify;">Long felt needs of fulfilling the basic civic needs, best educational support to all the children, caste neutral
                    communal hormony, social justice, women empowerment and local resource centered economic growth were forged well when
                    panchayat elections was declared in 1996 September by the then DMK lead state government. It clicked a signal in the
                    minds of many who were dreaming to achieve the above mentioned goals and the buoyancy of election process started after
                    more than a decade of non availability of panchayats in the village. Shri.R.Elango, took the lead in organaising the
                    meetings among different section of the community through the community group discussions about the new Panchayat raj
                    system. People felt the need of a good leader who could lead and make use of the system. Atlast it became the compulsion
                    that Shri.R.Elango quit his scientist job and contested to win. Efforts were taken to arrive the consensus but it became
                    election. In that he was elected with more than 2/3 majority.</p>
                    
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This became the opening for exploring the possibility of demonstrating developmental solutions in the village. Surveys
                    and data collections were done; meeting the families at their door step gave opportunity to understand their need and
                    also to make them to understand their role in building the future. A planning group was constituted with Panchayat ward
                    members and likeminded-experienced elders. The plan was discussed and validated by the gramashaba. The caption of the
                    plan was “All fifty years felt needs should be filled in five years”. Fund mobilisation, fund utilization, resources
                    from government schemes, resources from other options, local resource mobilization, local contributions, prioritization,
                    year wise implementation and evaluations were thoroughly discussed. Actually it became the peoples plan at the end when
                    it was validated by gramashaba.</p>

                </h4>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 2%;">Caste system is the curse prevailing among the village societies. It divides the people and creates hatred among the
                                village communities. The practice of untouchability, practice of providing separate tea cups for the so called lower
                                caste people in the tea shops and no entry for the dalits in the places of worship are some of the cruel practices
                                happening in the villages. Due to the persistent hard work the above mentioned social evils are neutralized in
                                Kuthambakkam village and a model new colony consisting of fifty twin houses were constructed along with common
                                facilities like good roads, drains, play lots, public distribution systems, a community hall and a child care centre.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 2%;">In every twin house one side a dalit family and the other side a non-dalit family was made to live. This became a
                                historical one because this was the first occasion to see the dalits and the other communities were living together in
                                the same locality. The proposal was placed before the then Chief Minister Dr.M.Karunanithi, he expressed his complete
                                satisfaction and coined the scheme “Samathuvapuram”. After Kuthambakkam initiatives more than 250 places across the
                                state, this program was implemented with the name ‘Samathuvapuram’ by the Government of Tamilnadu.

                </h4>

                <p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 2%;">In 1996, when the new panchayat took over charge, hundreds of families were involved in the production of illicit
                arrack. As a result, the illicit liquor was being sold at all the corners of the panchayat. Due to this, quarrels and
                violence occurred among individuals, groups and sometimes among the villages. The women and children were the worst
                affected by the intoxicated men.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 2%;">Strong
                
                efforts of the panchayat and the police with the co-operation of the state government had stopped the arrack production.
                People involved in the illicit business were rehabilitated and given jobs through various development programs of the
                panchayat. Many kinds of alternative employments were created. More and more such programs were introduced phase by
                phase.

                <p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 2%;">The construction of Samathuvapuram gave opportunity to use variety of cost effective and eco- friendly building
                materials and methods. The village people were well trained to produce these materials. After the Samathuvapuram
                program, number of consultations were held with the communities and a detailed plan was prepared to upgrade all houses
                in the village using the innovative building materials and methods. All huts were upgraded to pukka houses with the
                support of Rural Development Department - Government of India , Swiss Embassy-Delhi and Trust for Village Self
                Governance (TVSG). The village became a hut less village and the dignity of living in a safe house was enjoyed by the
                poor families. This became a good model and was celebrated by getting ‘UN – Habitat’ organization.

                This makes women and their family self reliant. Drilling, welding, quality checking are some of the technical works the
                women and the men undertook.
